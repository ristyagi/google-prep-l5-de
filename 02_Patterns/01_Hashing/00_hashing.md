# Hashtable, Hashmap and Hashing basics ⚡️

Hashtable and Hashmap are two terms used for that same data strucutre and dictionary is the pyton implementation of this datastructure.

### 1: What is Hashtable?
- **Hashtable:** A hash table (or hash map) is a fast data structure that stores key-value pairs, using a hash function to convert keys into array indices, allowing for quick lookups, insertions, and deletions, effectively acting as a dictionary or associative array.
- **Hashing:** Hashing is a process that uses a mathematical function (hash function) to convert any input data (like a password or file) into a fixed-size, unique string of characters called a "hash," primarily for fast data retrieval in data structures (like hash tables) or for secure data verification (like password storage).
