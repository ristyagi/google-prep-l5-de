# Google Data Engineering Interview Prep 🚀

This repository documents my journey as Senior Data Engineer to mastering DSA for Google (Target: L5). My focus is on writing efficient, Pythonic, and scalable code.

## 🛠 Tech Stack
- **Language:** Python 3.10+
- **Focus:** Time/Space Complexity, Scalable Data Structures
- **Platform:** LeetCode / Google Interview Style

## 📅 Roadmap & Status
| Topic | Status | Key Concept |
| :--- | :---: | :--- |
| **Arrays & Hashing** | 🟡 In Progress | $O(1)$ Lookups, Frequency Maps |
| **Two Pointers** | ⚪ Pending | In-place array manipulation |
| **Sliding Window** | ⚪ Pending | Stream processing / Moving Averages |
| **Heaps** | ⚪ Pending | Top-K Elements / Merging Log Files |

### Phase 1: Algorithmic Foundations
- [ ] **Arrays & Hashing** (Focus: Deduplication, Joins)
- [ ] **Two Pointers** (Focus: Sorted Data Merging)
- [ ] **Sliding Window** (Focus: Stream Processing)

### Phase 2: Advanced Data Structures
- [ ] **Heaps** (Focus: Top-K, K-way Merges)
- [ ] **Graphs** (Focus: DAGs, Dependency Trees)
- [ ] **Intervals** (Focus: Scheduling)

### Phase 3: Data Systems & Scale
- [ ] **Distributed Systems** (Sharding, Replication)
- [ ] **SQL Mastery** (Window Functions, Execution Plans)
- [ ] **System Design** (ETL Architecture, Pub/Sub)

## 📈 Methodology
Each solution includes:
1. **The Approach:** Why this data structure was chosen.
2. **Complexity:** Big O analysis for Time and Space.
3. **DE Context:** Real-world application of the algorithm.
